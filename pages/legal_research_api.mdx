# Legal Research API

There is only one endpoint for the legal research api. The goal of this endpoint is to given a legal question and some optional document attached, return a draft answer and all the documents relevant to answer that question.

It points to an [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/EventSource) that will stream multiple `json` objects.
We use the event approach because we compute part of the answer at different times, instead of waiting for everything to be ready this allow to show intermediate results as they come.

### Connect to the Endpoint

The endpoint url is: `https://springbootbackendapp.mangowave-7a18d2e6.switzerlandnorth.azurecontainerapps.io/app/advice/combined`

To connect to the EventStream, you need to send a `POST` request to the endpoint and listen to the events of the `EventSource`, each event has a type ( *response*, *considerationDetails*, *confidence*, *error*, *legalArea* ), the last event is of type *confidence*.

There are 2 parameters to add in the body of the `POST` request: 

| Parameter   | Type              | Required | Description   |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| `query`     | `string`          | Yes      | The legal question as a string.    |
| `documents` | Array of Objects  | No       | An array of objects, each with a `name` and `content` field as strings. These are the files attached to the question. |

Here is an example of an implementation in typescript (in this example we use the [`sse.js`](https://github.com/mpetazzoni/sse.js?files=1) package to force the `POST` request to create the `EventSource`):

```ts copy
import { SSE } from "sse.js";

const endpoint_url = "https://springbootbackendapp.mangowave-7a18d2e6.switzerlandnorth.azurecontainerapps.io/app/advice/combined"

const source = new SSE(endpoint_url, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json", 
    Authorization: `Bearer <token>`,
  },
  payload: JSON.stringify({
    "query": "I had an accident with a e-scooter in Zug, how can I reply to this letter ?"
    "fastMode": false,
    "documents": [
        {
          name : "letter_complaint",
          content: "Dear Sir/Madam, After ..."
        }
      ]
  }),
});
```

> There is a demo endoinpt that will fake all replies but keep the same format, this is usefull to speed up development and testing:  
> ```md copy
> https://springbootbackendapp.mangowave-7a18d2e6.switzerlandnorth.azurecontainerapps.io/demo/advice/combined
> ``` 

### Event types


#### *response* : Draft Stream
```json
{
  "response" : "string"
} 
```
You have to concatenate all the `response` strings to form the final draft. 
The last `response` include the string `<AILEGIS-END>`.

#### *considerationDetails* : Document List
```json
{
  "considerationDetails ": {
    "label": "paragraph|court_decision|commentary|document",
    "title": "string",
    "url": "string",
    "article_paragraphs_text": "string[]"
    "article_citations": "string[]",
    "relevant_ids": "number[]",
  }[]
}
```

- `label` : a string representing the type of the Document
- `title` : a string representing the title of the Document
- `url` : a string representing the url of the Document
- `article_paragraphs_text` : an array of string, each item of the array is a paragraph of the Document
- `article_citations` : an array of string, each item of the array is the title of the paragraph of `article_paragraphs_text` at that index
- `relevant_ids` : an array of number, each item of the array return a relevance score for the given question of the paragraph of `article_paragraphs_text` at that index. The number can have any value, it is used to compare paragraph within the same Document.

#### *legalArea* : Legal Area
```json
{
  "legalArea" : "string"
} 
```

#### *confidence* : Confidence Score
```json
{
  "confidence" : "number"
} 
```

#### *error* : Error
```json
{
  "error" : "string"
} 
```

### Fully functional example

> Do not forget to replace the `token` , if you do not have one look at the [authentication doc](/authentication)

```ts filename="example.ts" copy
import { SSE } from "sse.js";

const endpoint_url = "https://springbootbackendapp.mangowave-7a18d2e6.switzerlandnorth.azurecontainerapps.io/app/advice/combined"

const source = new SSE(endpoint_url, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json", 
    Authorization: `Bearer <token>`,
  },
  payload: JSON.stringify({
    "query": "I had an accident with a e-scooter in Zug, what can I do ?"
    "fastMode": false,
    "documents": []
  }),
});

source.addEventListener("message", async (e: { data: string }) => {
  let data = JSON.parse(e.data);
  console.log(data)
});
```

Example of output on the console: 
```md copy
{
  considerationDetails: [ {label: 'paragraph', title: 'VRV, 3. Teil: Verhalten bei Unfällen, Sicherung der Unfallstelle', relevant_ids: Array(1), url: 'https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1962/1364_1409_1420/de#art_54', article_citations: Array(3), …} , ... ]
}

{
  response: 'Given Article '
}

{
  response: 'VRV 3, you '
}

{
  response: 'are entitled to '
}

...

{
  response: 'best. <AILEGIS-END>'
}

{
  legalArea: "Construction law"
}

{
  confidence: 75
}
```
